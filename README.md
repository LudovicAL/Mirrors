# Mirrors
This project is made as an attempt to explore Unity's capabilities regarding the stencil buffer in the context of a Universal Render Pipeline project. It demonstrates techniques to make a mirror:
1. Using a double of the scene constructed behind the mirror
2. Using a secondary camera rendering on the mirror's mesh

An online version of the "game" can be accessed at https://ludovical.github.io/StencilShader/
(note that the page could take a few minutes to load the WebGL player in the background).
