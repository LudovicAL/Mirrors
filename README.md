# Mirrors
This project demonstrates two mirror-simulation-techniques:
1. Using a secondary camera rendering on the mirror's mesh.
2. Using a double of the scene constructed behind the mirror.

An online version of the "game" can be accessed at https://ludovical.github.io/Mirrors/
(note that the page could take a few minutes to load the WebGL player in the background).
